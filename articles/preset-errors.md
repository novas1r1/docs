## Why Track Errors?

Success is often defined in numbers such as Monthly Active Users (MAU) or Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). Churn is a metric that tracks the percentage of active/paying users who stoped using/paying for your app.

A smooth experience without bugs & issues is one of the key factors contributing to a lower churn rate. If you do a good job in continuuously fixing the most common issues with your product, you're on the right track for success. That's why it's important that you detect any common issues your users gets stuck at while using your app.

{% noteinfo "What Error Handling Really Is" %}
Error Handling is any logic that detects that something unexpected happened and reacts to that information in some useful way. It's commonly interpreted as 'showing an error message to my users', but that's just the most basic form of Error Handling. Other common things you can do to improve your app are Empty States (Why is this empty?), Call-to-Actions (What can I do?), and Auto-Repair (resiliency against common unexpected user input). But always make sure to give some form of feedback instead of failing silently, which makes your app feel broken.
