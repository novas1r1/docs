## Why Track Onboarding?

Success is often defined in numbers such as Monthly Active Users (MAU) or Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). Conversion is a metric that tracks what percentage of people who started your app became active/paying users. A high conversion rate therefore is directly related to how successful your app is.

A good Onboarding is one of the key factors contributing to a higher conversion rate. If your Onboarding does a good job in communicating how the user can get value from your product, you're on the right track for success. That's why it's important that you detect any steps your users gets stuck at during the Onboarding phase.

{% noteinfo "What Onboarding Really Is" %}
Onboarding is the entire process from a user seeing your app for the first time until they have become an active/paying customer. Showing a 'Walkthrough' screen on first app start can be part of your Onboarding, but it doesn't have to be and Onboarding certainly doesn't end there.
