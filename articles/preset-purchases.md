## Why Track Purchases?

If you are offering In-App Purchases in your app, you might have noticed some delay in officially reported purchase stats. For example, App Store Connect charts do not offer any purchase data for the last 3 hours. Such a delay can be very annoying sometimes such as the day of your app launch or a specific live event related to your app. On top of that, App Store Connect in particular signs you out of your account very regularly, making it annoying to quickly look up purchase statistics.

That's why you might want to set up a signal in your application to track purchases in your app through TelemetryDeck within seconds, providing you with the live data you want. This preset is entirely optional. Only set it up, if you need it.

{% notewarning "Live Data vs. Correct Data" %}
We do not offer any intelligence to correct once reported purchases, such as when users make refunds. Therefore, our insights focus on more recent data. For longer-term or 100% correct data, refer to official sources.
